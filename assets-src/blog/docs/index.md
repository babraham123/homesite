Configuration and bootstrapping scripts for a local, private cloud (aka a homelab). The goal is to create a zero-trust environment to serve web apps, manage media and work on tech projects. I strongly prioritized open source and self hosted software. High availability and automatic provisioning are non-goals given the scale of the system.

Note, this setup is just one way to implement a homelab. I've configured things with a certain set of goals in mind that might not fit everyone. Also there are probably great tools and best practices  that I'm simply unaware of. Either way, treat these guides and bash scripts as more of a source of inspiration.
